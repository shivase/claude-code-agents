An integrated development environment system that runs multiple Claude Code AI agents in parallel on tmux.
By providing instructions to the Product Owner, various Dev Role agents process tasks in parallel.

📖 [日本語README](../README.md)

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive toolkit for running multiple AI agents in parallel to streamline team development. It consists of two main components:

![screen_shot](screen_shot.png)

- **start-agents**: Main system for launching and managing AI agent sessions
- **send-agent**: Client tool for sending messages to running agents

## 🚀 Usage

### start-agents - AI Agent Session Management System

#### Preliminary Setup

Create the necessary environment information for startup using the `--init` command.
Files are saved by default to `~/.claude/claude-code-agents/agents.json`.

```bash
# Initialize configuration
start-agents --init

# Run system diagnostics
start-agents --doctor
```

#### Starting Agents

```bash
# Please specify a session name for startup
start-agents [session_name]
```

**Launched Agents:**
- `po`: Product Owner (Overall coordination)
- `manager`: Project Manager (Team management)
- `dev1-dev4`: Execution agents (Flexible role assignment)

#### Agent Definition Files

The operational definitions for various agents are stored in `~/.claude/claude-code-agents/instructions`.
Please modify them according to your environment as needed.
